<h1>ServiQuim Ecommerce</h1>
<p>ServiQuim Ecommerce is a prototype website designed and developed as a modern replacement for the outdated official site of Serviquim de Monterrey. The original website suffered from long loading times, poor frontend performance, and multiple visual and functional issues.

This new version was built from scratch with the goal of improving user experience, maintainability, and performance. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern and implements key backend concepts such as a custom router, DAO (Data Access Object) structure, Singleton pattern for database connection management, environment variables, and a centralized Front Controller.

The backend was developed using PHP, while the frontend was styled using SCSS. The project uses MySQL as the database engine, and includes several stored procedures to encapsulate complex queries and improve database performance and consistency.

<h2> 
  Lessons Learned & Areas for Improvement
</h2>

<p><strong>Code Reusability:</strong> Today I realize that a significant portion of the code could be refactored to improve the overall architecture by following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.</p>

<p><strong>File Structure:</strong> In current projects, I use a more organized and secure folder and file structure that improves both maintainability and scalability.</p>

<p><strong>Design and Frontend:</strong> Nowadays, I would rebuild the frontend using modern technologies like React or Angular to make it more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.</p>
